def dispatch(run_function):
    """
    In cases you have a run function calling external, probably insecure functionalities,
    use this function wrapper around your run function.

    Example:
        The run function can include any code you want. When the task runs,
        it is started in a subprocess and monitored by the parent process.
        When it dies unexpectedly (e.g. because of a segfault etc.)
        the task will be marked as failed. If not, it is successful.
        The log output will be written to two files in the log folder (marked with 
        the parameters of the task), which you can check afterwards::

            import b2luigi


            class MyTask(b2luigi.Task):
                @b2luigi.dispatch
                def run(self):
                    call_some_evil_function()

    Implementation note:
        In the subprocess we are calling the current sys.executable (which should by python 
        hopefully) with the current input file as a parameter, but let it only run this
        specific task (by handing over the task id and the `--batch-worker` option).
        The run function notices this and actually runs the task instead of dispatching again.

    You have the possibility to control what exactly is used as executable
    by setting the "executable" setting, which needs to be a list of strings.
    Additionally, you can add a ``cmd_prefix`` parameter to your class, which also
    needs to be a list of strings, which are prefixed to the current command (e.g.
    if you want to add a profiler to all your tasks)
